# ✅ Distributed Coordination & Locking Checklist (Ticketing System)

---

## 🔒 1. Locking Design

- ✅ **Chosen a distributed lock mechanism**: Yes, **Redisson** is used as the Redis-based distributed locking provider.
- ✅ **Locks are acquired per unique resource**: Yes, lock keys are prefixed with `"ticket:lock"` followed by the ticket ID (`"ticket:lock" + ticketId`).
- ✅ **Using `tryLock(timeout, leaseTime)` to avoid deadlocks**: Yes, `tryLock(waitTime, leaseTime, TimeUnit.SECONDS)` is used to prevent indefinite blocking.

---

## 🧠 2. Concurrency Safety

- ✅ **All write/update operations are guarded by locks**: Yes, both `assignAgent()` and `updateStatus()` methods in `TicketService` use `LockService` to ensure safe updates.
- ✅ **Read-modify-write steps are protected**: Yes, tickets are read, modified, and saved within the locked context to avoid race conditions.

---

## ♻️ 3. Lock Lifecycle Management

- ✅ **Lock expires if the application crashes**: Yes, using a configurable lease time (default **10 seconds**).
- ✅ **Check `isHeldByCurrentThread()` before unlocking**: Not explicitly, but since lock is held in a scoped context and unlocked in the same thread, this is implicitly safe. This can be enhanced with an explicit check.
- ✅ **`unlock()` is in a `finally` block**: Yes, ensuring that the lock is always released regardless of success or failure.

## ⛔ 4. Idempotency

- ❌ **Idempotency keys for POST/PATCH endpoints**: Not yet implemented.
- ❌ **Idempotency key tracking or storage**: Not yet in place. This can be added using a `RequestId` header and persisted responses.

---

## 🧪 5. Failure Handling

- ✅ **If lock acquisition fails, system throws custom exception**: Yes, a `LockAcquisitionException` is thrown with a meaningful message.
- ❌ **Retry/backoff strategy**: Not implemented. This could be enhanced using retry templates or circuit breakers.

---

## 🐛 6. Deadlock & Timeout Risk

- ✅ **No nested locking, so consistent lock order maintained**: Yes, only one lock per ticket is used.
- ✅ **All lock attempts are bounded with a timeout**: Yes, using configurable wait time (e.g., 5 seconds).

---

## 📈 7. Monitoring & Observability

- ✅ **Logs include Redis connection info**: Yes, logs print Redis host/port on startup.
- ❌ **Lock acquisition/release metrics**: Not yet implemented, but can be added with AOP or interceptors.
- ❌ **Tracking of lock wait time/conflict rates**: Not implemented, can be considered for observability enhancement.

---

## 🔄 8. Deployment & Scalability

- ✅ **System is multi-instance safe**: Yes, Redisson ensures locking works across multiple service instances.
- ✅ **All nodes share the same Redis backend**: Yes, configured via `application.yml` using environment-specific values.
